# Testing Web Apps with Cypress
I've discovered and learned to use Cypress, an efficient and user-friendly way to write end-to-end tests for client-side applications. I've mastered the selector engine, test runners, assertion library, and custom command creation. I've utilized Tasks in Node.js for seeding my database and applied mocking and stubbing methods to minimize reliance on external APIs. Moreover, I've successfully integrated my Cypress tests into my CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. This repository showcases my work and progress throughout the course.
